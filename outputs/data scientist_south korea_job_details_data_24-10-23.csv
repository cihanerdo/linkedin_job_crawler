최고의 인재들과 최고의 문제를 풀어 최대 다수의 사람들과 그 혜택을 나눌 수 있는 곳.
우리는 높은 이상을 가진 자들과 일하기를 원합니다. Tridge에 모인 사람들은 단순히 “최고의 직장”, “빠르게 성장하는 회사”, “높은 수준의 주인의식”을 추구해서 모인 사람들이 아닙니다. 이러한 것들은 어쩌면 How에 해당하는 것으로 최선의 결과를 내기 위해 당연히 필요한 것들이겠지요. 우리가 진정 추구하는 것은, 세상에 널리 퍼져 있는 문제이지만 사람들이 당연하게 생각하는, “정보 비대칭”, “ 시장 불균형”, “소득의 불균형”, “에이전트 문제” 등을 같이 해결하는 것입니다. 역사적으로 이러한 문제들을 풀기 위한 수많은 시도들이 있었음에도 불구하고 여전히 해결하지 못한 미완의 숙제로 남아 있는 것이 사실입니다. 팀 트릿지는 이러한 사실인식에 기반하여, 가장 지속가능하고, 가장 경제적이면서 합리적인 방법으로 문제를 해결하여, 전세계 많은 사람들이 그 혜택을 공유하기를 바라는 사람들입니다. 해결하고자 하는 문제가 크기 때문에 우리는 최고의 인재를 찾을 수밖에 없으며, 가장 효율적으로 일해야 하며, 각자 맡은 부분에 대해 책임감을 최대한 발휘하기 위해 주인의식이 중요할 수밖에 없습니다. 이러한 방법론은 선택이 아니라 필수입니다.
높은 수준의 교육을 받고, 높은 이상을 가지고 있으며, 좋은 사람들과 끊임없는 논의를 통해 인생의 가치를 찾고자 하는 열망이 있는 분들과 같이 하고 싶습니다. 우리가 나누는 모든 대화와 행동의 결과에서 하루하루의 의미를 재발견하실 수 있습니다.- 트릿지 커리어 페이지: https://www.tridge.com/career- 트릿지 블로그: https://blog.tridge.com/
